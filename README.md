option feasibility

oci use

okay, i am looking to optimise my bet sizing based on portfolio level kelly criterion (taking into account correlations). the aim is to run correlations.py to get the matrix and then feed the results into sizing.py for a truly optimised bet sizing in terms of how much capital i should risk, what each bet should look like, and also doing this in line with diversification with how much capital i have available. can you tell me (no coding) how this should be done

testing if i've done this correctly
